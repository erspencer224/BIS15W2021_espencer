Hi! I am [Emily](mailto:erspencer@ucdavis.edu), a third year Global Disease Biology student minoring in Global and International Studies with an emphasis on inequality. 

I am very excited to learn how to code in R, *which is what I will be using this repository to do!

 **Fun Facts About Me:**
* I am from Seattle, Washington
* I love to dance, read, and be on the ocean
* I am currently tutoring students living in Syria!

Here is a very large photo of my dog, Luna!
